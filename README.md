# Distributed Computing
This is the code that I submitted for the course BITS F382 Reading course on Distributed Systems. 
The code runs a simple task of counting till 20M on different threads, and the same task can also be divided among multiple computers, where the information of the task is shared via REDIS_URL variable. While running the code, also set your computer name in the code.
